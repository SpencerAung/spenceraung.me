*Hello World!* I am quite excited for my first blog post. 

First of all, let me talk a little bit about myself. I am a front-end Javascript developer. I am from Myanmar but currently located in Seoul, South Korea. I have been working as a web developer for almost 3 years. Even though my bachelor degrees is in Computer Science, my web development skills are mostly self-taught.

Most of the blog content will be about Javascript and React. I hope this blog will be helpful for other developers.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, please contact me at [aung.spencer@gmail.com](mailto:aung.spencer@gmail.com).
